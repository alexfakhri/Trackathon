  	<h2>About the Trackathon Team</h2>
			<p>On September 15th, 2014, the creators of Trackathon jumped straight into the deep end of the coding pool by starting their first day at <a href="http://www.makersacademy.com">Makers Academy</a>.</p>
			<p>Ten weeks (and more technologies than we care to list) later, final project time rolled around. Makers' brave students were presented with many potential challenges, including that of providing a tool for tracking teams' progress throughout the course of a hackathon.</p>
			<p>Five unlikely heroes rose to that challenge, persevering through many coding hardships. After two weeks of blood, sweat, tears, and many cans of Pringles, our team is proud to unleash Trackathon upon the world.</p>
